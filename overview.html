                                <p> Dodge History <br><br>Dodge, founded in 1900 by brothers John and Horace Dodge, 
                                    initially supplied parts and assemblies to Detroit-based automakers 
                                    before producing their own vehicles in 1914. 
                                    The company gained early recognition for its durable and reliable trucks, 
                                    which quickly became popular in the American market. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
                                    Dodge cemented its reputation for performance with the 
                                    introduction of iconic muscle cars like the Charger and Challenger. 
                                    The brand has faced various ownership changes and market 
                                    challenges over the years but has consistently remained a key player in the automotive industry. 
                                    Today, Dodge continues to innovate, focusing on high-performance vehicles and expanding 
                                    its lineup to include modern, powerful, and technologically advanced models</p>

                                <p>Ford Mustang History<br><br>
                                    The Mustang is a series of coupe- and convertible-style cars. 
                                    It was created by none other than Ford Motor Company, 
                                    a multinational American automobile manufacturer. Since entering the market in 1964, 
                                    it remains one of Ford's most sought-after products. In just its first year of production, 
                                    it blossomed into one of the best-selling automotives in the United States. 
                                    Over 418,000 models were sold, despite Ford only predicting 150,000 sales in year one. 
                                    It's also the company's longest-produced nameplate. 
                                    The Mustang also spurred the pony car trend. "Pony car" describes a compact, 
                                    affordable, sporty coupe or convertible. "Pony" also referenced its distinguishable horse logo. 
                                    The nickname surrounds all competitor cars created to rival the Mustang's
                                    performance and success. While today's models look vastly different than 
                                    their 1960s counterparts, the Ford Mustang remains a prized gem for its sleek, 
                                    stylish appearance and impressive performance. Modern takes of the vehicle include 
                                    state-of-the-art technology and ultra-powerful engines.</p>

                                <p>Chevrolet History<br><br>Chevrolet has been a staple in the United States automotive industry for over 100 years. 
                                    Its brand, along with its signature bowtie emblem makes each and every one of their 
                                    vehicles easily recognizable and synonymous with the automobile giant. The history of 
                                    this company is extensively decorated with many firsts of the industry as well as the 
                                    creation of multiple vehicles that became top-sellers in their class. With the original 
                                    mission statement of the company, ‘a car for every purse and purpose,’ its no wonder that 
                                    the Chevrolet brand became a leader in vehicle production and sales out of all the different 
                                    divisions of the General Motors Company. For the original ownership of Chevrolet, 
                                    their beginnings are somewhat of a success story among the beginnings of the automotive industry.
                                    Founded by William Durant and Louis Chevrolet in 1911, Durant used the company to 
                                    gain majority control of the General Motors Company. By 1919 and after a series of 
                                    oustings and reinstatements, Durant became president of GM and Chevrolet went on to 
                                    quickly become leader in sales as a General Motors Subdivision. Although Chevrolet and 
                                    GMC Vehicles shared vehicle platforms by the 1920’s, 
                                    GMC vehicles were primarily intended for commercial use, 
                                    while Chevrolet went on to be extremely successful with private consumers. 
                                    The first original Chevrolet Model was the Series C Classic Six. 
                                    The design was drawn up by Etienne Planch under direction from Louis Chevrolet and 
                                    released in 1913. The vehicle proved to be extremely expensive to assemble and the 
                                    cost for consumers was too great, so they quickly discontinued the line in favor of the much 
                                    cheaper Series 490. The 490 was ultimately the game-changer for Chevrolet. 
                                    The vehicle engine had an excellent price point and capability that took a 
                                    major chunk of sales from Ford’s Model T and placed Chevrolet on the map as a 
                                    major player in the industry. The 490 had a four-cylinder, 24 horsepower engine that would 
                                    be Chevrolet’s standard engine used in its vehicles until it was replaced by a 
                                    similar six-cylinder engine by 1930.</p>
